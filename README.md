# Fake-News-Detection-Project
The advent of the World Wide Web and the rapid adoption of social media platforms (such as Facebook and Twitter) paved the way for information dissemination that has never been witnessed in the human history before. With the current usage of social media platforms, consumers are creating and sharing more information than ever before, some of which are misleading with no relevance to reality. Automated classification of a text article as misinformation or disinformation is a challenging task. Even an expert in a particular domain has to explore multiple aspects before giving a verdict on the truthfulness of an article. In this work, we propose to use machine learning ensemble approach for automated classification of news articles. Our study explores different textual properties that can be used to distinguish fake contents from real. By using those properties, we train a combination of different machine learning algorithms using various ensemble methods and evaluate their performance on 4 real world datasets. Experimental evaluation confirms the superior performance of our proposed ensemble learner approach

Project is in Python Programming.


# Prerequisites
What things you need to install the software and how to install them:

Python 3.6
This setup requires that your machine has python 3.6 installed on it. you can refer to this url https://www.python.org/downloads/ to download python. Once you have python downloaded and installed, you will need to setup PATH variables (if you want to run python program directly, detail instructions are below in how to run software section). To do that check this: https://www.pythoncentral.io/add-python-to-path-python-is-not-recognized-as-an-internal-or-external-command/.
Setting up PATH variable is optional as you can also run program without it and more instruction are given below on this topic.
Second and easier option is to download anaconda and use its anaconda prompt to run the commands. To install anaconda check this url https://www.anaconda.com/download/
You will also need to download and install below 3 packages after you install either python or anaconda from the steps above
Sklearn (scikit-learn)
numpy
scipy
if you have chosen to install python 3.6 then run below commands in command prompt/terminal to install these packages
### pip install -U scikit-learn
### pip install numpy
### pip install scipy
if you have chosen to install anaconda then run below commands in anaconda prompt to install these packages
### conda install -c scikit-learn
### conda install -c anaconda numpy
### conda install -c anaconda scipy
